## Phase 1 (UI)

To get rid of confusing we will copy the design from [instagram](http://instagram.com) and in phase 8 we will make our custom design

###### possible problems: no problems

## Phase 2 (Localization)

Supports arabic and english using i18next and fix design issues that will happen from changing the language

###### possible problems: small issues in design

## Phase 3 (Authentication & Authorization)

add protected routes with next server side feature (middlewares) using next (Auth.js) using cookies and not local storage we may use custom hooks from ayam mobile app

###### possible problems: no problems

## Phase 4 (State management with redux)

clone redux from the mobile app

###### possible problems: may all redux features not work with all components because next13+ work by default on server

###### solution: convert server component to client component

## Phase 5 (implement the api)

clone the hooks from the mobile app and implement it in the web app

###### possible problems: some hooks will not work correctly because the different nature between web & mobile development

## Phase 6 (Happy testing )

test everything to be sure that the app is working correctly

## Phase 7 (storybook) optional

apply philosophy of atomic design to make adding new features to the app easier

## Phase 8 (customize the design) optional

follow figma design

## Phase 9 (deployment)
